## Changed in v2022.32

* Major mining of mobs and loot
* Fix the addon being stuck in debug mode for everyone because of a bad check (say goodbye to "ID" and "location" on all the map tooltips)
* Since we were stuck in debug mode for everyone, everyone has been getting experiemental mob-name code for the last few releases... so properly release that and clean up. This noticably reduces SavedVariables size and memory usage.
